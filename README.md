# Oasis Pro Manual 

This project aims to simulate the Oasis Pro medical device.

The project closely follows the following manual (unless otherwise stated in the documentation): https://bio-medical.com/media/support/mind-alive-oasis-with-ces-users-manaul.pdf

Reading pages 2-3 of the manual would provide a good summary of what the device does. 

### Features
The device currently has the following features implemented:
1. Turning on/off and ending a session (see manual pg.4)
2. Battery draining and monitoring (see manual pg. 5)
3. Selecting a session (see manual pg.5)
4. Connection test (see manual pg.6)
5. Adjusting intensity (see manual pg.7)

Note that we also have extra features:
1. Simulating device disconnection 
2. Simulating battery death
3. Simulating charging
4. Saving session data (this was done differently from how it was stated in the manual)

### Use Cases
The following use case diagram provides an excellent summary of this program: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s9hUwO1D4sARyVloWfA6x9uFLQJ8F48z4Psa8Jytkq8/edit

Note: Bolded steps in the use cases refer to other use cases.
